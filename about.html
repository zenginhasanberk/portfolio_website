        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I am Hasan, and I am studying computer science and economics at the University of Michigan. Even though I considered consulting as a career for a while due to my economics major, I've realized in my time at Michigan that I am a lot more interested in computer science. This was mostly thanks to Michigan's Data Structures & Algorithms course (EECS 281), and my time working on tech projects as part of my on-campus consulting club, both of which were very enjoyable and taught me a lot.
        </p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <div>
            <p>I've gained a wide range of skills thanks to my extracurricular involvements and self-studying. I took part in two tech projects in my on-campus consulting organization, <a href="https://www.meccconsulting.com/"target="_blank">MECC</a>, for one of which I was the project manager. Through these projects I learned hard skills such as <strong>Dart and Flutter</strong>, as well as soft skills such as leading a team, setting clear expectations, and creating a supportive team environment. In my own time, I learned <strong>Python (Django), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development, and SQL, SQLite, and Postgres for the databases in my apps.</strong></p>

            <p>You can find detailed information about my personal projects or other projects I were a part of on the <a href="skills_and_projects.html">skills and projects page</a>.</p>
