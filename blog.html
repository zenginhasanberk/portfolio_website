        Recently I started to think that the more you "document" your work, the
        easier it is to keep motivated. For that reason, I will try to
        periodically write here about my recent progress on some personal
        projects or schoolwork. I don't know how this will work out but I wanted
        to try it out.

          I watched a tutorial about how to make mobile games on Swift. This
          tutorial was mainly to learn to SpriteKit library, which seems to be
          used heavily for 2D games. After that I spent some time continuing the
          Verlet Integration tutorial I've been following. The tutorial is about
          how to accurately represent object movement in computer simulations
          using Verlet integration. I really want to go deeper into physics
          engine programming and computer graphics with my personal projects, so
          I enjoy this tutorial a lot. After these, I continued my Operating
          System lecture about Thread-safe Queue.
